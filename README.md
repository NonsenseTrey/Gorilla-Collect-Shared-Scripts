WARNING: even though the MIT license say you can... I say you CANNOT distrubute my scripts through other sources (unless you edited it then its fine)

So I bassically am sharing the scripts I use for my game so I'ma add what they do down here

I swear to goodness if you say these scripts are yours I'm going to fart all over you.
Also I hate to say it but some scripts were enhanced by ChatGPT.

#what the scripts do

-HandMach, it matches one object's position with another object's

-buy item, Uses Playfab & Photon Pun, when an object with the script is touched by a object with the tag "HandTag" it will then check if the player has enough currency then will deduct the amount then spawn the object at a certain position.

-ghost, every now and then, an obect will appear at a certain position then dissapear; dissapears automatically if it is touched by an object.

-gift fall, spawns an object at a random object's position.

-giftcollect, uses Photon Pun, when the object is touched by another object with the tag "HandTag" it will spawn a random object.

-lever choose, activates 1 random object.

-mine, uses Playfab, gives currency to the player.

-mutate, kinda complex so just read the script.

-shipmove, bassically moves an object's position with buttons.

-shipping, uses Photon Pun, bassically this script is a core feature of Gorilla Collect, its kinda complex so in short, detects if a object with a specific tag is touching it then spawns a random object (and you can choose if the object touching the object with the script and/or a other object is destroyed).

-trash, uses Photon Pun, just deletes an object upon touch if it has the "item" tag, you can choose if a new object is spawned when another is "trashed."
